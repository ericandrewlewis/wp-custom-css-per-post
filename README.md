# wp-custom-css-per-post

Weston said I can more natively register settings for saving.

Preferably changes aren't "saved," only drafted and then shoved into
Edit Post screen in hidden input box.

Should detect whether the page is loaded via customize-loader
and save data instead of closing the window.
